            Hello World brand new page
        </h1>
        <h2>
            It can even do like that:
        </h2>
        <p>
            <span title="Hoorooombooroooom">
                <bdo dir="rtl">
                    Hoorooombooroooom
                </bdo>
            </span>
        </p>

        <u>
            One more thing to mention: you cannot use &lt;u&gt; tag in strict mode since it was deprecated.
            But it's OK in transitional one. Or use styling, it's 2016 by the way.

                Actually, I'm not sure about how useful this functionality is, but HTML 4.01 invented noscript tag.
